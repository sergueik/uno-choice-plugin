uno-choice-plugin (now is Active Choices)
=================

A Jenkins **UI plugin for selecting one or multiple options for a job parameter**. It provides a number of capabilities in a single plugin some, but not all, of which can be found amongst several other plugins. Note that as of May 2015 the plugin has been contributed to the Jenkins user community under the name [Active Choices plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Active+Choices+Plugin) and can be obtained via the standard Jenkins Plugin Update Center.

The plugin supports:

1. Selecting one or multiple options for a parameter
2. Combo-box, check-box and radio button UI
3. Dynamic generation of option values from a groovy command or Scriptler script
4. Cascading updates when job form parameters change
5. Displaying reference parameters (a new type of Jenkins UI parameter) which are dynamically generated, support cascading updates, and are displayed as a variety of HTML formatted elements on the job form.
 
This plugin is developed in support of the diverse computational requirements of life-science Jenkins applications as proposed by the [BioUno project](http://biouno.org/)

We ask that issues 
related to this plug-in are now kept in the Jenkins JIRA.

Visit the [Active Choices plugin Wiki](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Active+Choices+Plugin) for a detailed explanation of each parameter type. You may also find additional help and tutorials posted at the [Uno-Choice plugin wiki](https://github.com/biouno/uno-choice-plugin/wiki)
